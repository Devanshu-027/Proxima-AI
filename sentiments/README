Sentiment Analyzer: Detailed Workflow
=====================================

Project Overview:
-----------------
The Sentiment Analyzer is an AI-powered tool designed to classify text data in CSV files by sentiment. 
It leverages pre-trained transformer models from Hugging Face, allowing users to process batches 
of reviews and generate actionable insights through CSV outputs and visualization charts.

Purpose:
--------
- Demonstrate sentiment analysis with modern NLP models.
- Provide a tool for analyzing large sets of text efficiently.
- Educate on model behavior, preprocessing, and visualization.
- Showcase professional Python coding practices in AI pipelines.

Key Components & Workflow:
--------------------------
1. Input:
   - CSV file with a mandatory 'review' column.
   - Optionally, the user can specify a Hugging Face transformer model.

2. Data Loading & Validation:
   - CSV file is read using pandas.
   - Validation ensures that 'review' column exists; otherwise, the program exits with a clear error.
   - Missing reviews are handled as empty strings.

3. Sentiment Analysis:
   - Hugging Face pipeline 'sentiment-analysis' is used.
   - Model (default: 'distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english') encodes reviews.
   - Each review is truncated to 512 characters to respect model limitations.
   - Iterative analysis with tqdm provides a progress bar.
   - Fallbacks ('UNKNOWN') are used for any errors in processing.

4. Results Processing:
   - Sentiment labels are appended to the original DataFrame.
   - Both numeric counts and percentages for each sentiment are calculated.

5. Output:
   - Updated CSV file saved as '{original_filename}_with_sentiment.csv'.
   - Bar chart 'sentiment_distribution.png' visualizes sentiment distribution.
   - Console prints summary statistics including counts and percentages.

6. Error Handling:
   - Handles missing files, invalid CSV formats, empty 'review' column.
   - Handles exceptions during model loading and inference gracefully.
   - Warns and skips problematic reviews instead of crashing.

7. Customization:
   - Users can provide alternative Hugging Face sentiment models.
   - Color scheme of the chart can be adjusted.
   - Can be extended for multi-class sentiment, multilingual models, or real-time streaming data.

8. Limitations:
   - Pre-trained models may carry biases or fail on domain-specific text.
   - Batch processing only; not real-time.
   - Maximum sequence length is 512 tokens; longer text is truncated.
   - Default model only provides binary sentiment; fine-tuning is needed for more nuanced labels.

Summary:
--------
The Sentiment Analyzer provides a full pipeline from raw text data to actionable insights. 
It combines data validation, AI inference, results aggregation, and visualization into a 
professional-grade Python application. This workflow can be expanded for larger datasets, 
different transformer models, or integrated into production environments.
